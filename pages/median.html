    <h1>Making use of median in real life</h1>

    <h3>Scenario</h3>
    <p>
        In this example, you want to figure out the average money of a student  in their wallet in your classroom. <br>
        You might be tempted to use the mean to get the average, <strong>however what if one student carries a lot of money</strong>. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        money (in US dollars) = [100, 150, 90, 87, 110, <strong style="color:red">10000</strong>] <br>
        Now, let's get the average using the mean. <br>
        Heads up, this will be incredibly inaccurate! <br>
        100 + 150 + 90 + 87 + 110 + 10000 = 10,537 <br>
        10,537 / 6 = <b>$1756.17</b> <br>
        <strong>So, in this case we use median instead of mean.</strong> 
    </p>
    <h3>How to get median</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Sort the values into ascending order. <br>
            87, 90, 100, 110, 150, 10000
        </li>
        <li>
            Get the middle value, in this case it's values. <br>
            100 and 110. Add the two middle values and divide it by two. <br>
            <strong>You get $105.0 which makes sense than $1756.17 right?</strong>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Mean</th>
                <th>Median</th>

        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>The mean is not a robust tool... <br> since it is largely influenced by outliers.</td>
                <td>The median is better suited for skewed distributions to derive at central tendency... <br> since it is much more robust and sensible.</td>
            </tr>
