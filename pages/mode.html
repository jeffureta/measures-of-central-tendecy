    <h3>Scenario</h3>
    <P>
        In this example, you want to know the most common car brand in a car museum. <br>
        Disclaimer, I'm not a car guy. I know little about cars. <br>
        Car brand is a categorical data type meaning we're not dealing with numbers here. <br>
        To know which car brand is the most common, you need to count the car brands and get the highest frequency. <br>
        Car brands = Toyota, Honda, Ford <br>
        I know the picture doesn't show Toyota, Honda, nor Ford ðŸ˜‚. 
    </P>
    <h3>How to get the mode</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Count the cars by brand.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Sort the numbers lowest to highest and see which number appears the most often.</p>
